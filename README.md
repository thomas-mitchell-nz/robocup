## RoboCup Autonomous Robot
An autonomous robot designed for the 2022 RoboCup Challenge, built to navigate an arena, avoid obstacles, collect target weights, and pursue a mobile “snitch.”

**Features:**
- Autonomous pathfinding with ultrasonic, infrared, and time-of-flight sensors
- Finite state machine controlling movement and object interaction
- Collision avoidance logic integrated with drive and steering systems
- Servo-actuated mechanisms for weight collection and delivery

**Project Demo:**  
*Note: The robot I developed starts on the green base.*
